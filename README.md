# MalDev
This repository contains code snippets and projects through my MalDev learning experience. 

My intention is to learn a number of malware techniques and for each one, attempt to recreate it in multiple programming languages. 

All techniques I'm learning will be in C/C++ first as that's the language I'm the most familiar with. Other languages will come later as I learn how to recreate it in that language.

I plan on including the following content:
- Local Injection
- DLL Injection
  - Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection (sRDI)
- Remote Process Injection
  - Mapping Injection
  - APC Injection/EarlyBird APC Injection
  - Function Stomping/Restorative Function Stomping
- Anti-Debug
- Anti-VM
- Anti-Static

and more...
