# MalDev
This repository contains code snippets and projects through my MalDev learning experience. My intention is to learn a number of techniques and for each one, try to recreate it in multiple programming languages. All techniques I'm learning will be in C/C++ first as that's the language I'm the most familiar with. Other language will come later as I learn how to recreate it in that language.
